# Used Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about various factors such as the car's brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and other relevant features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "used_cars.csv" dataset, which includes information about used cars and their corresponding prices. It contains features such as the car's brand, model, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission type, and other relevant attributes.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of used cars based on the available features. The project will involve the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: This step involves exploring the dataset, understanding the features, and handling any missing or inconsistent data. Data cleaning, feature selection, and feature engineering may also be performed to prepare the data for model training.

2. **Feature Engineering**: In this step, we will analyze the existing features and create new features that can potentially improve the predictive power of the model. This may include transforming categorical variables, encoding brand and model information, or extracting relevant features from text descriptions.

3. **Model Selection and Training**: Various regression algorithms will be evaluated and compared to select the best model for this task. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets, and the chosen model will be trained using the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its performance and accuracy. This step will help in understanding how well the model generalizes to unseen data and predicts the prices of used cars.

5. **Price Prediction**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the prices of used cars by providing the relevant features as input.
